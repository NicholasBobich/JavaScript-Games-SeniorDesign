Mocha
https://mochajs.org/#getting-started

Mocha is a testing framework for JavaScript that will help use unit and system test our games. 
It can be running on a browser or Node.js for simple easy testing. On the following website there is examples 
on how to get started and shows where to set up and store the files. Mocha is also on GitHub and is being supported 
and update constantly. We will be able to use this Framework to test function in our games and the overall game to 
see if there is any errors or faults that we couldnâ€™t caught with our eyes.
